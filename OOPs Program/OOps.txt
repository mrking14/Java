Object Oriented is A Programming Methodology that simplify the Software Devlopment &  Maintenance, By providding Some Rules .

The Basic Concept of OOPs :-
1>  Class 
2> Object
3> Encapsulation
4> Polymorphism
5> Inheritence
6> Abstraction 


Class:-    The Class is nothing just a representation os silimar type of onject. Class means Something must be categorized. It's also called Blue Print or tamplete. The Tapmlete describes the kinds od State and Behaviour.

Class contails Data Members and Member Funtions
    The Data Members shows the property of an object .
    The Member Function shows the Behaviour of an Object. 


Object:-     Any Entity that has state and Behaviour is known as Object. Object created on the base od Class. 





Encapsulation:-       Encapsulation is the mechanism to binds the Data Members and Member Funtions together. And Variable of the code keep safe from Outside Misuse or Interferece.
Eg:- Class is the greatest Example of Encapsulation.


Polymorphism:-   Polymorphism means many Forms , this is the Concept of OOps for Reducing Complexity od an Object. It can be Achieved by Behaviour of an Object.

 There are 2 type of Polymorphism
   1> Compile Time Polymorphism
        *> Function OverLoading

   2> Run Time Polymorphism
        *> Function OverRidding
